<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

### Demo

### Target Audience

This document is intended for developers, testers, and anyone involved in the development and maintenance of the **b√ºnd** app.

<hr style="border-top: 2px dashed #999;">

<!-- Development Environment Setup -->
## Environment Setup

### Software and Tools

To set up the development environment for **b√ºnd**, you'll need the following software and tools:

- Flutter SDK (v3.16.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (v3.2.2 or later)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (with Flutter and Dart plugins)
- Git for version control

### Installation Instructions

- Install Flutter and Dart by following the official documentation "[Visit](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)".
- Configure your preferred IDE with the Flutter and Dart plugins.
- Open the whole app in your IDE.
- Clone the repository from Git & add it inside `pubspec.yaml`
- Run **`flutter pub get`** command.
- Create **Emulator/Simulator** Connect Physical Device:
    - Open a terminal in your IDE or use the terminal directly.
    - Run the command **`flutter run`** to build and launch your app on the connected emulator or device.
- Run the App:
    - To run your Flutter app, you'll need either an emulator or a physical device. You can create a virtual device using **Android Studio** or **Xcode**, depending on whether you are developing for Android or iOS.
    - If you prefer testing on a physical device, connect it to your computer and ensure that USB debugging is enabled.
- Resolve Dependencies:
    - If there are any missing dependencies or issues with packages, the terminal will guide you on how to resolve them. You may need to run additional commands like **`flutter pub upgrade`** or **`flutter packages get`** to ensure that all dependencies are installed.

<!-- Project Architecture** Overview -->
## Project **Architecture** "Overview"

The **b√ºnd** app adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. Our architecture comprises the following key components:

- Presentation Layer: Manages the user interface, screens, and UI logic.
- Domain Layer: Contains the core business logic and use cases.
- Data Layer: Handles data access and storage, including external APIs and databases.

In addition to Clean Architecture, we leverage Flutter's widget-based UI development to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.
